# parity-project-1

## Goal

The goal of this project is to determine how you approach solving data and code
problems. The project should not take more than four to eight hours to complete.

We would like you to download some weather data (from anywhere in the
world - your choice!) using a script. There must be data from at least **10** locations.

Take that data and store it in a more simplified format in a SQL table. How you decide
to do that is up to you, but be prepared to justify any data simplifications
you make!

## Data source

Get free weather data using the [ODWeather API](https://api.oceandrivers.com/static/docs.html)

## Repository format

Pick your own repository format (directories/folders, download scripts, SQL tables)

## Rubric

We will score your project on the following criteria:

1. Organization
2. Readability
3. Scalability
4. Performance
