# parity-project-1

## Goal

The goal of this project is to determine how you approach solving data and code
problems. The project should not take more than four to eight hours to complete.

## Deliverables

We would like you to download some weather data (from anywhere in the
world - your choice!) using a script you author. There must be data from
at least **10** locations.

Take that downloaded data, transform it into a more simplified format,
and store it in a SQL table. How you decide to do that is up to you,
but be prepared to justify any data simplifications you make!

So in summary, at the very least you must provide:

1. Data download script
2. Data transformation script
3. SQL table(s) storing the transformed data

## Data source

Get free weather data using the [ODWeather API](https://api.oceandrivers.com/static/docs.html)

## Repository format

Pick your own repository format (directories/folders, download scripts, SQL tables)

## Rubric

We will score your project on the following criteria:

1. Organization
2. Readability
3. Scalability
4. Performance
